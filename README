NAME

    Dancer::Plugin::Piwik - Generate JS code for Piwik

VERSION

    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

    In your configuration:

      plugins:
        Piwik:
          id: "your-id"
          url: "your-url"
          username_session_key: 'piwik_username'

    The username_session_key is optional. If set, the plugin will look into
    the session value for the given key and set that as the tracked
    username. You probably want to that in an hook.

    In your module

        use Dancer ':syntax';
        use Dancer::Plugin::Piwik;
    
        # if use'ing Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible;
        hook before => sub {
            if (my $user = logged_in_user) {
                session(piwik_username => $user->username);
            }
            else {
                session(piwik_username => undef);
            }
        }

CONFIGURATION

    Two keys are required:

 id

    The numeric id of the tracked site (you find it in the Piwik admin).

 url

    The url of the tracking site, without protocol and without trailing
    slash. E.g.

     mysite.org/stats

EXPORTED KEYWORDS

    All the following keywords support the boolean argument ajax. Instead
    of the javascript, a perl structure will be returned.

 piwik

    Return generic code for page view tracking. No argument required.

 piwik_category(category => "name")

    Generate js for category pages. Requires a named argument category with
    the name of the category to track.

 piwik_view(product => { sku => $sku, description => $desc, categories =>
 \@categories, price => $price })

    Generate js for flypages. Expects a named argument product, paired with
    an hashref with the product data, having the following keys

    sku

    description

    categories

      (an arrayref with the names of the categories). An empty arrayref can
      do as well).

    price

      The price of the item

 piwik_cart(cart => \@items, subtotal => $subtotal)

    Generate js for cart view. Requires two named arguments. The cart
    argument must point to an arrayref of hashref products, with the same
    keys of piwik_view, and an additional key quantity.

 piwik_search(search => { query => 'query', category => 'category', matches
 => 10 }};

    Generate js for search results. Requires a search argument with the
    data to pass to piwik. The only mandatory value is query.

 piwik_order(cart => \@items, order => { order_number => $id, total_cost =>
 $total, subtotal => $subtotal, taxes => $taxes, shipping => $shipping,
 discount => $discount }

    Generate js for the receipt. Two required arguments: cart is the same
    as piwik_cart, while order is an hashref with the following keys:

    order_number (required)

    total_cost (required)

    subtotal (optional)

    taxes (optional)

    shipping (optional)

    discount (optional)
